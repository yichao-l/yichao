I'm interested in pursuing the complementary goals of engineering more human-like machine intelligence systems and understanding human learning in computational terms by exercising a variety of tools -- primarily, Neural Networks, Probabilistic Modelling, Formal Language -- rooted in areas in maths --  Calculus, Probability, Algebra and Logic -- and guided by ideas from different communities -- Artificial Intelligence, Cognitive Science, and Neuroscience -- and more broadly methodologies from empirical, theoretical, computational and data-driven science.
